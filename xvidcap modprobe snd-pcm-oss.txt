/dev/dsp is OSS. 

You can try starting XVidCap from command line like this: aoss xvidcap
If I need to run OSS based apps, however, I load the oss modules like this (as root): 

sudo modprobe snd-pcm-oss 


Alsa-oss is, in my experience, a bit slow to respond and so you might get synch problems. 

Tal vez si después de cargar el módulo cambio en xvidcap de

/dev/dsp

a:

/dev/snd

A ver qué pasaría

Un señor dice:

This gives me sound in ALSA applications. Now I want to run an old program that needs OSS, so I installed

alsa-oss
 
and did 

sudo modprobe snd-pcm-oss snd-mixer-oss

When I run the old program, I get sound, but only from the analog line out, not from HDMI, so the OSS emulation uses the first card.

How can I tell the OSS emulation to use the second card instead?

Hi guys !
I recently updated my pi (around March 10th).
I was using alsa-oss, loading modules snd-mixer-oss & snd-pcm-oss.
It seems that since this upgrade I can't use/load these modules anymore :
modprobe: FATAL: Module snd-mixer-oss not found.
modprobe: FATAL: Module snd-pcm-oss not found.
Does it make sense ? Can you help me ?

Best Regards
Pete

I installed osspd-alsa and the performance is back to where it was before the upgrade.
